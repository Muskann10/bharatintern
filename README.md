# README for Data Analysis Tasks

This README provides a summary of three data analysis tasks performed using Python and various libraries, including pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Each task focuses on a different dataset and analysis, as outlined below:

## Task 1: House Price Prediction

- **Dataset**: A housing price dataset ('datasethousepred.csv') containing information about residential properties.

- **Tasks Performed**:
  1. Data Exploration: Loaded and examined the dataset, including the first 15 rows, data types, and unique values of columns.
  2. Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, one-hot encoded categorical variables, and split the dataset into features and target variables.
  3. Model Building: Trained a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
  4. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using the R^2 score and made predictions on new data.

## Task 2: Wine Quality Classification

- **Dataset**: A wine quality dataset ('WineQTdataset.csv') with information about different wine attributes and their quality ratings.

- **Tasks Performed**:
  1. Data Exploration: Loaded and examined the dataset, checked for missing values, and visualized data distributions.
  2. Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed redundant columns, and prepared the data for classification.
  3. Model Building: Trained both Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models to classify wine quality.
  4. Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using ROC AUC scores and generated a confusion matrix.

## Task 3: Iris Flower Species Classification

- **Dataset**: The Iris dataset containing measurements of iris flowers' sepal and petal dimensions and their species.

- **Tasks Performed**:
  1. Data Exploration: Loaded and examined the dataset, checked for missing values, and selected feature and target columns.
  2. Data Preprocessing: Split the data into training and testing sets for classification.
  3. Model Building: Trained a Decision Tree Classifier to classify iris flower species.
  4. Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance and visualized the decision tree structure.

Each task's code and analysis have been provided in their respective sections. The README summarizes the key steps and outcomes of these data analysis tasks.

For detailed code and output, refer to the individual sections for each task.

If you have any questions or need further information about any of these tasks, please feel free to ask.
